# Modular-base-system
A compromize base solution for AoS and WHFB
I am learning Blender and trying to solve the round vs square bases issue.
The system will, in its firsts iteration, have round disks with a conecting square peg sloting into either 20x20mm square or 25mm round bases.
The .stl files may have scaling issues due to Blender(or my inexperience in it).
