# Modular-base-system
A compromize base solution for AoS and WHFB.
I am learning Blender and trying to solve the round vs square bases issue.
The system will, in its firsts iteration, have round disks with a conecting square peg sloting into either 20x20mm square or 25mm round bases.
The .stl files may have scaling issues due to Blender(or my inexperience in it).

There are slots for magnetizing with 5x1mm disk magnets, for the smaller models it may be appropriate to use 5mm washers of magnetic metal in the bases.

This is still not done: things are missing and things may be wrong.
